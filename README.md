# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Domain Model

**Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** is a software development approach focused on creating a robust domain model that is aligned with business needs. Within this model, three key concepts are essential to properly represent business logic: **Value Object**, **Entity**, and **Aggregate Root**. These concepts help structure the system cohesively, ensuring it is scalable and easy to maintain.

## Domain Modeling with DDD:

### 1. Value Object:
A **Value Object** is an object that does not have its own identity and is defined by its attributes. It is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed after it is created. If modification is needed, a new object is created instead.

**Example**: **Contact** is a **Value Object**, as it represents contact information such as email, address, and phone number, and does not have a unique identity. It can be replaced but not altered.

### 2. Entity:
An **Entity** has a unique identity and can change over time. Even if its attributes change, the entity's identity remains the same.

**Example**: **PersonalData** is an **Entity**, as it has a unique identity and can be modified (e.g., changing the name or contact information), but its identity remains intact.

### 3. Aggregate Root:
The **Aggregate Root** is an entity that serves as the entry point for accessing and modifying a cluster of related entities and value objects. It ensures the consistency and integrity of all objects within the aggregate.

**Example**: **Athlete** is the **Aggregate Root** in your model because it is the main entity that manages the aggregate of related data, such as **PersonalData** and **Category**. **Athlete** ensures that all associated data is consistent and that business rules are applied correctly.

## DDD and Domain Model

In your model, DDD applies as follows:
- **Value Object**: **Contact** represents immutable contact data.
- **Entity**: **PersonalData** has a unique identity and can be changed over time.
- **Aggregate Root**: **Athlete** is the **Aggregate Root**, as it manages the consistency and integrity of related data, such as **PersonalData** and **Category**.

This domain model structure, using **DDD**, helps create a more flexible, cohesive, and maintainable system, allowing business rules to be implemented clearly and efficiently.
